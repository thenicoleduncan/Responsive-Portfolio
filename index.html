  <!-- 4. Inside your `Responsive-Portfolio` folder, find your `styles.css` file. You will write your media queries at the
  bottom of `styles.css`.

  5. Use three `@media screen` tags, each with one of these `max-width`s: `980px`, `768px` and `640px`.

  * You use `980px` because you never want any of the content to be cut off. Since the desktop layout is about 960px
  wide, you want the media queries to kick in before your content gets cut off.

  * `768px` is about the width of a tablet and `640px` is about the width of a phone in landscape.

  6. Make the layout match the following screenshots:

  * `index.html`: [980px](Images/980-index.jpg), [768px](Images/768-index.jpg), [640px](Images/640-index.jpg)

  * `portfolio.html`: [980px](Images/980-portfolio.jpg), [768px](Images/768-portfolio.jpg),
  [640px](Images/640-portfolio.jpg)

  * `contact.html`: [980px](Images/980-contact.jpg), [768px](Images/768-contact.jpg), [640px](Images/640-contact.jpg)

  7. Make the position of the header `static` (the default positioning) when the screen is `640px` wide. The header
  design takes up a lot of room; you don't want it to stick to the top of a small screen and leave no room for the rest
  of your site.

  8. Be sure to include the `viewport` tag in all your HTML files, otherwise your media-queries won't function as
  expected on mobile devices. _(Hint: You won't need to use exact pixels for anything other than the container)_

  9. **Protip**: Use the Chrome extensions [Window
  Resizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh) and [Browser
  Width](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browser-width/mlnegepkjlccabakompdmbcmdieaideh) to see the browser
  dimensions in Chrome. -->

      <p class="lead">Hey visitors! Welcome to my online home. My name is Nicole Duncan and I am an aspiring web
        developer.
        I
        am
        currently attending the University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp for Continuing and
        Professional
        Education.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        I spent two years at Mesa Community College trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my
        life.
        After
        switching majors four times, I decided to do more research into the web design and coding
        world.
        I
        ended
        up
        running into this coding program by happen stance and decidied to quit school and give this
        a
        go.
        It's
        been
        the best decision I have ever made!
      </p>
      <p class="lead">I would encourage everyone to follow their dreams and to never settle for less. We all have
        something
        that we
        are good at and are meant to do. So do it!</p>
