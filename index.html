      <p class="lead">Hey visitors! Welcome to my online home. My name is Nicole Duncan and I am an aspiring web
        developer.
        I
        am
        currently attending the University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp for Continuing and
        Professional
        Education.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        I spent two years at Mesa Community College trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my
        life.
        After
        switching majors four times, I decided to do more research into the web design and coding
        world.
        I
        ended
        up
        running into this coding program by happen stance and decidied to give this
        a
        go.
        It's
        been
        the best decision I have ever made!
        I would encourage everyone to follow their dreams. We all have
        something
        that we
        are good at and are meant to do. So do it!</p>
